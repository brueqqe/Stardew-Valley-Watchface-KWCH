The watchface displays the following information:
- **Time**: 12/24 hour format can be changed in KWCH.
- **Date**
- **Battery**: The health and energy bars show the battery status of the watch (W) and phone (P). The colour of the bars changes as you lose energy/battery. The exhaustion icon is displayed when the battery is below 15%.
- **Day Progress**: The arrow moves according to the time of the sunrise and sunset.
- **Steps**: The current number of steps (S) is displayed instead of a gold counter.
- **Temperature**: In addition to the step counter, there is a second counter showing the current temperature (T).
- **Daily calendar event**: If you have a daily calendar event, the journal icon is displayed. The icon also acts as a shortcut to open the calendar application on the watch.
- **Seasons icon**: The season icon changes according to the current season.
- **Temperature icon**: The temperature icon cannot currently be changed based on the actual weather. Therefore, the festival icon is always displayed.
- **Background**: Different backgrounds for day and night (based on sunset and sunrise times).

## Installation Guide
To use the Portal Watchface, the KWCH Kustom Watchface Creator app must be installed on the smartphone. IMPORTANT: To import the Portal Watchface, the Pro version of the app must be purchased.

Due to Google's restriction on non-Watch Face Format (WFF) watchfaces, KWCH is no longer available in the Google Play Store. However, you can still download the APKs from the official website of the creator of KWCH: [KWCH download link](https://docs.kustom.rocks/docs/general_information/cracked_free/)

NOTE: KWCH cannot be used on smartwatches with Wear OS 5 initially installed. Older watches that have been updated will still work (e.g. Samsung Watch 6).

NOTE 2: To import the watchface you need to purchase the pro Version of KWCH which costs 1$ (lifetime, no abo).
